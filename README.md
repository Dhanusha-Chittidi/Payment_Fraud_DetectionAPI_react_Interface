# Payment_Fraud_DetectionAPI_react_Interface
1.Developed a Machine learning model which which detects frauds in online payments using Decision Tress,Random Forest ,Logistic regression with an accuracy of 99.12%.

2.Converted this into an API using FastAPI at the backend,used packages like pydantic,uvicorn,pickle,CORSMiddleware (python libraries).

3.Used ngrok to generate a public URL for the API

4.We have created an Graphical User Interface  using React JS at the Frontend to help non technical users.

5.Used react-hook-form to create a dynamic form ,yup to validate the data which the user enters,axios to post that data to pubic url which is generated by ngrok.

6.After the processing has been done by ML model(API),send back the result in the form of promise object.

7.The message(Payment is fraud or not) is extracted from promise object and displayed on the Interface.
